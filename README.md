# Triad Health.

`Triad Health` is a patient/ user support site that solely acts as a connector between a patient seeking to identify a hospital that treats certain diseases and are endowed for the task. The hospitals are ranked in the ministry of health according to the level of endowment of both human capital and specialisation equipment.

Certain specific hospitals have been the creme of treating specific diseases out of doing it for sometime. `Triad health` acts as a slot-in between a patient looking for the best hopital for a given disease and the hospital that carries the best treatment and success stories.
`Triad Health` web application has a list of the most sought after medical services for long term illness and the correspondent best hospitals for the illnesses. When a user gets to the site, they are able to see the main services in the home page and can click on any service to be taken to the exact hospital that best does the treatment.

Once in the specific hospital page, a user can be able to see a hopital's pricing model i.e the accepted way to make payment for a service, the rank of the hospital in the ministry of health and the treatment schedule i.e when the hospital specialist is usually available for consultation and treatment. Besides, a user can make an appointment in the identified hospital and tell how many people are ahead of them by appointment.
A user can also take a tour of the listed hospitals, filter and search based on level and a hospital name.

For a hospital owner visiting `Triad Health`, they view the structuring of the information and are able to add their hospital by including all the necessary details ncluding name, avatar and a journal snippets for their specialisation. Triad Health later verifies that the hospital is indeed specialised in the service and evaluates the information presented and updates the hospital in the site.

The last feature of `Triad health` is the ability of a user to read a hospital's health journal on the service that it has been listed for. This enables a user to really be sure about the service they expect.

## Technologies.

The following are the technologies that have been used to realize this project:
  
  1. React Js
  2. CSS
  3. Javascript.
  3. A Rest Server.

## Accessing the hosted project.
   
This project is hosted in a model of halves. The frontend that is built using React.js is hosted on `Netlify` while the support `Json server` is hosted on `Heroku`.

The project can be accessed live at [Triad Health.](https://triadhealth.netlify.app/).

  ## Get a copy/ personify.

The following is the process of getting your own copy of the project.

`Triad Health` is  verion-controlled in two different github repositories, one for the Json server `https://github.com/samuelmwaura/triadHealthJsonServer  ` and the other carrying the app interface `https://github.com/samuelmwaura/triadhealth`;

To get copies of each:
   1. Navigate to the main project's github repo via the link, `https://github.com/samuelmwaura/triadhealth`
   2. Click the fork button to fork it to your personal github account.
   3. Once you have a copy in your github account,copy the ssh url -`git@github.com:samuelmwaura/triadhealth.git` or the https - `https://github.com/samuelmwaura/triadhealth.git` depending on the preference and the github access configuration of your machine.
   3. Open your terminal (Unix OSs are the presumed operating system for your computer.For any other operating systems, the instruction might be different) and navigate to the folder your desire the project to be located

   Use the following command to clone the project locally.
   ```bash
   git clone preferred url;
   ```
  Once the project user interface has been cloned to the local machine, navigate to the created project directory , `cd "Project Directory"`.Open your code editor in this folder to access the project sourcecode. This process is similar for the project server code acquisition.
